# Detect ADR Opportunities

## Instructions

### 1. Focus on Architectural Decision Triggers

Watch for these key indicators:

- **Technology changes**: Database switches (Postgres, MySQL, Mongo, Redis), message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ), cache layers, event buses, protocols (gRPC/REST), major libraries/frameworks
- **Non-functional requirements**: Performance, reliability, security, compliance, scalability
- **Architectural patterns**: Circuit breakers, feature flags, service mesh, API gateways, observability (OpenTelemetry)

### 2. Analyze Git Context

When reviewing changes:

```bash
# Get recent changed files
git diff --name-only HEAD~50..HEAD | sort -u

# Search for architectural triggers in changed files
grep -R -n -E "(kafka|rabbitmq|redis|postgres|mongodb|grpc|rest api|otel|opentelemetry|feature flag|circuit breaker|service mesh|api gateway|load balanc|rate limit)" <files>
```

### 3. Identify ADR-Worthy Changes

An ADR is needed when:

- A technology choice impacts multiple components or teams
- There are clear trade-offs between options
- The decision has long-term consequences
- Non-functional requirements are significantly affected
- Architectural boundaries or patterns are introduced/modified

### 4. Propose ADR Creation

When an architectural decision is identified:

1. **Draft a brief proposal** using MADR/Nygard structure:
   - **Context**: What is the architectural issue or change?
   - **Forces**: What constraints, requirements, or trade-offs exist?
   - **Options**: What alternatives were considered?
   - **Decision drivers**: What factors influenced the choice?

2. **Generate canonical ADR name**: `YYYYMMDD-<kebab-case-title>`

3. **Invoke the slash command**:

   ```
   /archdocs/adr "<Title>" --status proposed --template madr --scope <area> --id auto
   ```

4. **Prepare ADR skeleton** with these sections:
   - Context and Problem Statement
   - Decision Drivers
   - Considered Options
   - Decision Outcome
   - Consequences (positive and negative)
   - Links to related ADRs/RFCs

### 5. Quality Guidelines

- **Link to RFCs**: If an RFC exists, check its status and propose linking it to the ADR
- **Filter noise**: Dependency updates without architectural property changes don't require ADRs
- **Check for duplicates**: Search existing ADRs before proposing new ones:

  ```bash
  grep -r -i "<topic>" docs/adr/ .context1000/decisions/adr/
  ```

## Example Workflow

### Scenario: Migration from HTTP to gRPC

```
Detected: Service X migrating from HTTP REST to gRPC for inter-service communication.

Analysis:
- Context: Need for better performance, type safety, and streaming capabilities
- Forces: Team expertise, tooling support, backward compatibility
- Options: HTTP/2, gRPC, GraphQL
- Decision drivers: Performance requirements, type safety, bi-directional streaming

Proposal: Create ADR
Title: "Adopt gRPC for Inter-Service Communication in Service X"
Command: /archdocs/adr "Adopt gRPC for Inter-Service Communication in Service X" --status proposed --template madr --scope service-x
```

### Scenario: Introducing Redis Cache Layer

```
Detected: Addition of Redis as caching layer between API and database.

Analysis:
- Context: Database query performance degradation under load
- Forces: Cost, operational complexity, cache invalidation strategy
- Options: In-memory cache, Redis, Memcached
- Decision drivers: Persistence requirements, distributed architecture, eviction policies

Proposal: Create ADR
Title: "Introduce Redis for API Response Caching"
Command: /archdocs/adr "Introduce Redis for API Response Caching" --status proposed --template madr --scope platform
```

## Integration Points

- **With RFCâ†’ADR Linker**: If an RFC drove this decision, link them
- **With Architecture Diff Analyzer**: For large-scale changes, coordinate artifact types
- **With Doc Style Enforcer**: Ensure created ADRs follow template standards
